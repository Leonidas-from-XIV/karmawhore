# Karmawhore - an IRC karma tracker library #

Usage:

    $ lein run your-log.file

It generates the histogram to stdout. This requires leiningen >= 1.4.2,
because of a bugfix made after 1.4.1. Older versions work, but require
a workaround.

If you are curious, you can also run the unittests by issuing the

    $ lein test

command, which runs karmawhore on a self-test mode checking the
features. Don't worry when some fail, releases should be working
just fine. It is mostly a developer-thingie.
